I upload my solutions here to keep track of them between devices.
NOTE: not all of the folders contains full solutions, and some scripts require user to follow a few steps (commented in the script itself) in order for the solution to return the flag.
Servers update: the server have updated last month and some solutions remaind incomplte as the website was down and I couln't access them.
